TODO Bugs:
1. check two heating rod temp, if they are the same
2. release the bot screw when program paused
3. try step in the final stage of curing

GUI pending:
3. C# Close, wait for [motors Idle] then close the program
4. Fix XYZ shortcut bugs

Beetle:
#2: T2x needs to lubricate
#5: Motor 3 burned

Control Box #1: 
for Beetle #2 and #5, motors sometimes don't run

Notes:
1. If x or y interp failed constantly during curing, it means the positioning is not 
   accurate. Need to adjust the PID parameters or/and add some damp on the motor.
2. Glue needs to be uniform, important. For cooling, if not uniform, it can drift.
   Jig needs to be rigid and has small thermal expansion (Stainless Steel), important.
3. Screws cannot be too tight
4. Try to apply epoxy on the lens cap end instead of the side to make sure uniformity
5. Try stopping vibration by some foam
6. Just before getting solid during curing, the loss can drift because of the moves. See curing8 and curing10
7. Loss drift: 1. avoid unequal material expansion from top and bot, meaning top and bot should have
                  about the same length; and they should be shorter
               2. should be stable earlier than epoxy solid
               3. Epoxy should be even for uniform cooling down. 
               4. When starting cooling, unscrew the bot first cause bot cooling can be slower and uneven
