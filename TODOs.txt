TODO Bugs:

Jerry
GUI pending:
3. C# Close, wait for [motors Idle] then close the program
4. Fix XYZ shortcut bugs

Beetle:
#2: T2x needs to lubricate
#5: Motor 3 burned

Control Box #1: 
for Beetle #2 and #5, motors sometimes don't run

Notes:
1. If x or y interp failed constantly during curing, it means the positioning is not 
   accurate. Need to adjust the PID parameters or/and add some damp on the motor.
2. Glue needs to be uniform, important. For cooling, if not uniform, it can drift.
   Jig needs to be rigid and has small thermal expansion (Stainless Steel), important.
3. Screws cannot be too tight, use spring loaded clamp for clamping force consistancy. 
5. Try stopping vibration by some foam
7. Loss drift: 1. avoid unequal material expansion from top and bot, meaning top and bot should have
                  about the same length and expand along the same direction.
               2. Jigs should be thermal stable earlier than epoxy solid. Can preheating to make it quicker 
                  to reach stable temprature. Epoxy is usually solid at 7-9min when 190C curng. This is very important!!!
               3. Epoxy should be even for uniform cooling down. 
               4. When starting cooling, unscrew the bot first cause bot cooling can be slower and uneven
