TODO Bugs:
1. Click close, then auto align again, it will stop in the middle
2. During curing, when failed continuesly for many times, then we loose the criteria larger
   Curing final stages when meeting criteria, if loss change is slow, pause the program 
   consider Final stages, use only z back

GUI pending:
3. C# Close, wait for [motors Idle] then close the program
4. Fix XYZ shortcut bugs

Beetle:
#2: T2x needs to lubricate
#5: Motor 3 burned

Control Box #1: 
for Beetle #2 and #5, motors sometimes don't run

Notes:
1. If x or y interp failed constantly during curing, it means the positioning is not 
   accurate. Need to adjust the PID parameters or/and add some damp on the motor.
2. Glue needs to be uniform, important. For cooling, if not uniform, it can drift.
   Jig needs to be rigid and has small thermal expansion (Stainless Steel), important.
3. Screws cannot be too tight
4. Try to apply epoxy on the lens cap end instead of the side to make sure uniformity
5. Try stopping vibration by some foam
6. Just before getting solid during curing, the loss can drift because of the moves. See curing8 and curing10
