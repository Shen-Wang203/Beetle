GUI pending:

Beetle:
#2: T2x needs to lubricate
#5: Motor 3 burned

Control Box #1: 
for Beetle #2 and #5, motors sometimes don't run

Notes:
1. If x or y interp failed constantly during curing, it means the positioning is not 
   accurate. Need to adjust the PID parameters or/and add some damp on the motor.
2. Glue needs to be uniform, important.
   Jig needs to be rigid and has small thermal expansion (Stainless Steel), important.
